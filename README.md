CS3733 Software Engineering Final Project in Collaboration with Brigham and Womens Hospital

This project is the culmination of your Software Engineering course. In this project our goal was to create a Java app that would be used by the Brigham and Womens Hospital employees and would complete various tasks. One of the main aspects of this project was creating a graphical map editor that would be used to display various service requests (Lab service request, Meal service requests, etc.) and their locations on the map. In addition to these requests it would display all of the equipment in the hospital and their locations. Along with this map editor there would be a dashboard that would display display most of the data that showed up on the map that would be easy to understand for the employees. Seperate from the map editor there were many service requests that would be useful to the employees for whatever they needed. If they needed a meal for their patient they could request it and it would be written to the Apache Derby database to be completed.


My contributions in this project were mulitple. My main contribution was the dashboard for the graphical map editor were I took data from our database that was written to the map editor and translated it into charts and graphs that would display relavent information in a way that anyone could understand. Below is an image of the final dashboard.
